## TODO

1) ~~Update highlight color on neotree, is hard to see~~
2) Fix navigation inside wkdflow plugin
3) Neo-tree save session
4) Navigation in cmp using ctrl+j and k
5) Keep showing current buffer file in status line even if we are focusing neo tree (is getting invisible when using neotree)
6) Remove auto adding comment when pressing enter after a commented line
7) If I do :w in neotree should save current buffer instead of trying to save the tree
8) ~~Show number line in the current line I am~~
9) Find a propper keybinding for closing current buffer
10) Deactivate J and K so it dont move the line up and down (it should still work with Shift + j/k)
